Word2Vec.scala.bk3 is the backup of summing gradient and less negative sampling version 
Word2Vec.scala.bk2 is the backup of summing gradient version
Word2Vec.scala.bk is the backup of averaging lookup-table version

task now:
1.MSSkipGram read lookup-table from file, parameter matrix is zero (averaging lookup-table version)
2.SkipGram: summing gradient version

I am debuging the summing gradient version, there are something I need to change:
1.change the average of gradient to sum
2.monitor the training, accuracy or loss??

another version is possible: change negative sampling of lastword to negative sampling of word

loss of training dataset is to evaluate the convergence of algorithm
loss of testing dataset is to evaluate if the algorithm is good

NEXT TASK:
TRAIN NEW VERSION OF MSSKIPGRAM
