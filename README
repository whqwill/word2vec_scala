Word2Vec.scala.bk2 is the backup of summing gradient version
Word2Vec.scala.bk is the backup of averaging lookup-table version

task now:
1.MSSkipGram read lookup-table from file, parameter matrix is zero (averaging lookup-table version)
2.SkipGram: summing gradient version

I am debuging the summing gradient version, there are something I need to change:
1.change the average of gradient to sum
2.monitor the training, accuracy or loss??
